# consumer_finances_in_usa
In this project, we're going to work with data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). The SCF is a survey sponsored by the US Federal Reserve. It tracks financial, demographic, and opinion information about families in the United States. The survey is conducted every three years, and we'll work with an extract of the results from 2022.
